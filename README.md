# css_grid

I built this **modern responsive website** as a part of an online course created and designed by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.

The entire website is designed around the **CSS grid layout** properties.

The CSS Grid Layout enables **two-dimensional layout** without requiring the additional markup for row wrappers. It is easy to redefine the layout from the grid container. **Responsive design** is more **straightforward** and give the ability to **fine-tune the design at different breakpoints**.

The main purpose of this project is to show how **easy** it is to build a **fully responsive web page** using **CSS grid layout**.
